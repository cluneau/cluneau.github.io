The transition has not been easy for Yves, as he is still trying to adjust to the Korean culture and language. However, he has been taking classes in the Korean language and is determined to learn the language so that he can communicate better with the locals. He is also learning about the countryâ€™s culture and customs, and has already made some Korean friends.<br />
<br />
Yves is actively exploring the country and is taking advantage of the many outdoor activities available in Korea. He loves to hike and explore the mountains of Korea and has also been enjoying the great food. He is also taking up new hobbies such as calligraphy, taekwondo and photography.<br />
<br />
Yves is grateful for the opportunity to live in Korea and is determined to take full advantage of his new life. He is excited to make the most out of his time in the country and is confident that he will be able to fully adapt to the Korean way of life.</body>
